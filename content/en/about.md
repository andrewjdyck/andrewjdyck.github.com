I am an individual motivated by data-driven decision making, especially when applied to environmental issues. I have worked as a Fisheries Economist, Credit Risk Analyst, and founded two non-profit organizations, OpenFisheries.org and Open Data Saskatchewan. These two organizations are focused on improving the data availability, accessibility, and promotion of the message of transparency.

My wife Jen and I have a daughter and two cats. We enjoy travel and spending time outdoors as much as possible.
