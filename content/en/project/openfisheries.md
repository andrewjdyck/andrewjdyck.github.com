The global fishing industry is of great interest to me since my tenure as a Fisheries Economics with the [Fisheries Economics Research Unit](http://feru.oceans.ubc.ca/). Getting and using data for this globally influential industry is very difficult and the aim of this project is to improve the situation through collection of disparate data sources and publishing them regularly through the [OpenFisheries REST API](). 

The project homepage is http://www.openfisheries.org/ and code associated with the project can be [viewed and/or forked on Github](https://github.com/OpenFisheries).
