Since 2011, I've been organizing hackathons and collecting open data sources for the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. I cannot take credit for for it, but since the project began there have been 2 open data portals spring up in Saskatchewan ([Regina](http://open.regina.ca/) & [Saskatoon](http://opendata-saskatoon.cloudapp.net/)).

I continue to pull together whatever scattered open data sources may exist into the project website, http://www.opendatask.ca/.
