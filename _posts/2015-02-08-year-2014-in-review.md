Around this time last year, I tried out something that I haven't done before, which is to [publicly set a list of goals for the year](http://www.andrewdyck.com/a-new-years-post/). What's the point of doing this unless one does a retrospective afterwards to measure progress?

### Goals from 2014 ###
- **Blog more:** Here I managed to publish just one post other than the goal setting one last year. Not too great, however, this is one more post than the year before. 
- **Put more effort in OpenFisheries.org:** Measured up a little better with this one. Two big pushes on this project that haven't quite had big rewards so far for the project, but are all part of the building process:
  - **Hosting website and API on Github:** At some point during the year, [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com) changed something with my shared virtual server that affected how the [OpenFisheries.org](http://openfisheries.org) website API worked and this caused the API to die. Rather than spend a ton of time figuring out how to fix the implementation on Dreamhost, which was rather flaky to begin with, I took this as an opportunity to move the site and API to be hosted through Github Pages. This was a great opportunity to experiment with something that I'd be interested in for a while (static APIs) and the turn-around time to fix was quite quick. Now that the project is hosted completely on Github, it should be easier for others to use, re-use, copy and contribute.
  - **Published first R package:** This was the biggest step of the two for this year. Many of the algorithms in the global fisheries sphere are not terribly complex, but they are practically hidden from the scientific computing world in fisheries journals because these are rarely read by those outside the field. [This package for the R programming language](https://github.com/OpenFisheries/ropenfisheries) builds on the OpenFisheries API and puts some of these global fisheries analysis algorithms out for use by others. 
- **Take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course:** I did not follow-through with this goal at all really. I find myself in an odd place where I'm quite bored at the beginning of these courses, even though I'm sure there are opportunities to learn near the end of the course. Currently I'm 1 week into the [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) through John's Hopkins University. I'm taking some very introductory courses ([The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox) and [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog)), which can be a bit boring, but I'm picking up a few things here and there.
- **Invest more in other people:** This has been by far the most successful of the goals in this list, although, it's extremely difficult to measure concretely. This year I had the opportunity to participate in the hiring committee for a colleague, which was and continues to be quite rewarding. I've also been working with a colleague on a machine learning project who has shared with me as much of her experience with project management and I've shared experience with Econometrics.
- **Complete predictive CFL model:**: Much as I predicted, modelling Canadian Football has been quite difficult. However, during this season, another CFL enthusiast [published a website](http://www.cflstats.ca/) that includes a great deal of CFL stats in a very accessible format. Due in part to this person's efforts, I was able to spend some time on modelling of win/loss prediction for CFL teams. It's still half-baked for now, but I've pushed all my work so far to [Github in this repository](https://github.com/andrewjdyck/cfl-football-stats).

### Goals for 2015 ###
- **Continue to invest in others:** Something I will focus on here is listening for positive intent in others and trying to put myself into their shoes. I think that this can be the foundation for building strong partnerships. Furthermore, I'd like to have more regular check-ins with mentors and mentees throughout the year to better take advantage of opportunities that might present themselves for my colleagues and myself.
- **Push to Github:** Throughout this year there were too many times when I do some work on a side project, be it open data, CFL, or fisheries and I didn't commit anything to the public realm. On the internet, if you can't find it, it didn't happen. This includes personal blogging as well now that I'm running my blog on Github Pages.
- **Open Data blogging:** Recently I connected with [Graham Haines](https://twitter.com/grahamhaines), who is very keen to collaborate on an open data focused blog. He has a lot of great ideas and I think that together we can make some great headway.
- **OpenFisheries.org:** Here I think that the main goal in the short term is to get more engagement from the fisheries research community. I'm open to thinking about other audiences, but for now, researchers are the main focus. Two ways that I plan to engage with researchers over the next year are to:
  - **Expand the API:** Spatial disaggregation, Subsidies, and biological assessments are just the start.
  - **Publish analyses using the API:** Reproducible code snippets through Github should prove to be a great way to make connections with the research community.
  - **Establish a Board of Advisors:** Probably the most important of the three is to get commitment from 2 to 4 people who can serve as advisors for the project. Their input will be valuable in helping set priority for project undertakings and also help in spreading the word of the project.

Now to check in on these goals in 2016!
