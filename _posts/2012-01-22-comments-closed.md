After reading a very insightful post a few weeks ago (that I&#8217;ve since lost the link to&#8230;sorry), I&#8217;ve decided to close the comments section on all posts on my blog. Yes, the spam is annoying to deal with, but I&#8217;ve had some great experiences over the years meeting people who comment on my posts. I don&#8217;t want to miss out on that, so I hope that readers will take the time to [send me an e-mail][1] or hit me up on [twitter][2]. 

I hope that by forcing blog comments to go through by e-mail inbox I will make a more personal connection with those who contact me. But, by far what I see as the biggest potential benefit of moving comments free is that it may encourage more people to start blogging or engaging with others on Twitter. It&#8217;s very easy to leave a comment on a blog post and never come back to follow the discussion. Also, when you do leave a comment on someone&#8217;s blog, it becomes more about them than about your own work &#8212; maybe one reason blog comment sections are a favoured home of internet trolls. 

I hope that when potential commenters realize that they cannot leave their mark on a blog post of mine they will do one of two things:

  1. Send me their comment in an e-mail and we can discuss. I&#8217;ll then update the post with changes and/or additions as necessary
  2. Write a blog post, tweet, website, whatever of their own

I&#8217;d like to see potential commenters take that moment of insight that a post on this blog inspired and create something new of their own. This is especially important for a number of topics that I write about where there aren&#8217;t a million other blogs covering the territory. For example, there are only a handful of Stata focused blogs and it will be a long time before the open data scene suffers from over-coverage.

I hope that this little experiment is positive. If you have any comments on this experiment of mine, please feel free to [get in contact with me][3]. Or, write a blog post of your own with your thoughts on why blog comments are good, bad, or ugly.
