Whether it&#8217;s for work, school, or personal use, many people use multiple computers to get things done these days. So if you are using many different computers why have your files on just one of those computers, continually transferring copies of them around with portable USB drives? This eventually ends up in time wasted determining which is the most recent version of your TPS report, the one on your desktop, laptop, or USB drive.

[<img src="https://www.getdropbox.com/static/images/dropbox_logo_home.png" alt="Get Dropbox" align="left" />][1]To deal with this problem I&#8217;ve been using Dropbox for the past year or so. There are other competitors to Dropbox including Box.net among others, but I&#8217;ve only used just the one so that&#8217;s all I can vouch for. Once setup, the program automatically syncs my work files with my laptop and vice-versa so I never have to worry about forgetting them at the office or getting them mixed up with other copies&#8230;.now which one is the most recent version of that term paper again?

Setting up Dropbox is easy and I can outline it in a few steps.  
1. Download and install the program from <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/" target="_blank">http://www.getdropbox.com</a>*  
2. After the install you&#8217;ll be asked where to place your dropbox folder. It&#8217;s probably best to put this in a location that&#8217;s easy to access. In my case, as a windows user, my dropbox is in the My Documents folder.  
3. You&#8217;ll now be asked to sign up for a Dropbox account if you don&#8217;t have one. Doing so is painless.  
4. Only files that are inside your Dropbox folder will be synced so cut-and-paste whichever files you&#8217;d like to sync into the dropbox location on your computer. If you are just testing it out maybe you&#8217;d like to try putting a blank text document into the dropbox to see how it works.  
5. All set, now you can repeat these steps on computers that you want files synced with and everytime you make changes to your TPS report at home they&#8217;ll show up at work the next morning.

Lastly, when on a computer that you don&#8217;t use on a regular basis you can access your dropbox files from the web by logging into [http://www.getdropbox.com][2]. Of course this may make some people squirmy about confidentiality of their data so use your judgement when placing files into your dropbox.

The free version of dropbox includes 2GB of synced storage, which is plenty good for my uses. You can increase your storage space up to 100GB but it&#8217;ll cost you.

* If you are interested in trying out Dropbox you can also <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTMwODQ0OTk" target="_blank">visit this link</a>, which does the same as above but earns me an extra 250mb of storage space. You can&#8217;t blame me for putting it out there can you?
