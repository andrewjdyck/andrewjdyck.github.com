I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of powerpoint but it does seem likely that we can add this to the &#8216;death & taxes&#8217; category &#8211; they are always going to be with us. Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that we are doomed to suffering through hours of text crammed into bullet points. Visit [noteandpoint.com][1] for some excellent examples of beautiful and effective powerpoint presentations.

If I were in marketing this might even be a message that I would care about. For more tips on how to stifle the yawns at your next presentation you may want to try some of the following:
