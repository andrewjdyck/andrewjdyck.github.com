This graphic from <a href="http://www.labnol.org/internet/sites-blocked-in-china/12450/" target="_blank">digital inspiration</a> provides a stunning picture for a westerner like myself what it might be like to surf the web in China.

To be honest, I always imagined that most of the censorship in China revolved around specific topics like the Tiananmen Square massacre. I was somewhat surprised to find that sites blocked include Wikipedia, CBC, New York Times, etc. and that words as broad as &#8220;independence&#8221; and &#8220;democracy&#8221; are filtered from search results. This infographic really makes me appreciate the relative freedom that we Canadians enjoy on the web.
