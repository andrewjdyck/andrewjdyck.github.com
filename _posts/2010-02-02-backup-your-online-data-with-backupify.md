I&#8217;m a big proponent of data backups. <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> (<a href="http://www.andrewdyck.com/using-dropbox-to-sync-your-files-across-computers/" target="_self">which I&#8217;ve discussed before</a>) saved me countless hours of pain and work when my hard drive crashed beyond repair on my desktop at work last year. I had only been at the job for a few months at the time but I would have lost absolutely everything I had done if not for my online backups.

Dropbox is an application that syncs files on your hard drive over the web, essentially bridging the gap between your physical computer and &#8216;the cloud&#8217;. However, many have gone beyond the need for a physical hard drive entirely and choose to store their data solely on the web. For these folks, enter <a href="http://www.backupify.com/" target="_blank">Backupify for data backups</a>.

I have Backupify running with several on-line services I use including Gmail, Google Docs, and Flickr. Now, should anything unfortunate happen with one of these services (like the dreaded Gmail lockout) I have a backup that I should be able to restore from.

So far I love Backupify because it gives me a little peace of mind. Although, this peace might be premature because, as far as I can tell, the method to restore from the backups isn&#8217;t completely clear for some services. However, it&#8217;s better to have a backup and work out how to restore later rather than to have no backup at all.

Backupify is <a href="https://secure.backupify.com/signup" target="_blank">currently offering free accounts</a> for anyone who signs up before February 15th so you can try it out without committing financially. As far as I can tell, if you sign up before February 15th, you will have a permanent free account&#8230;&#8230;but don&#8217;t quote me on that.
