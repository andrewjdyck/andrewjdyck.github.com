From what I&#8217;ve seen so far, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/landing/games10/index.html" target="_blank">Google maps landing pages</a> may have be the best source for Vancouver 2010 Olympic information. On the landing page you can find Olympic news, information about medal winners and national ranking by medals won, detailed venue information and more. When looking up a hockey event I&#8217;m attending this week I found the location on the map as well as the roster for each team playing.

You can use the embedded Olympics gadget below to search for more Vancouver 2010 information or go to the main maps landing page to customize your own gadget. Unfortunately, due to the width of the gadget the one below doesn&#8217;t include the map portion, which is one of the big features so I highly recommend <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/landing/games10/index.html" target="_blank">visiting the main landing page</a>.



There are also other links on the main landing page like user submitted<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/WinterGames2010#" target="_blank"> photos from Picasa</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ctvolympics" target="_blank">videos on YouTube</a> and real-time search results.
