As a Saskatchewan native, I&#8217;m a huge fan of the Roughriders and the Canadian Football League (CFL) in general. My love of football collided with my love of technology when I decided to follow CFL games using my on-line calendar. The official CFL website does offer team schedules in iCal that can be imported into Google Calendar, which I use. However, if you want to follow the entire league instead of just one team, they don&#8217;t have an option for that. So, I grabbed the full season schedule from the <a href="http://cfldb.ca/schedules/" target="_blank">Canadian Football League Database (CFLDB)</a> and added it to my calendar. It works great and now I can see all the upcoming games on my calendar.

I haven&#8217;t spent much more time on the CFLDB website but it looks like a nice source for information about the CFL. The owner has even converted a copy of the official rulebook from PDF to a search-friendly web format.
