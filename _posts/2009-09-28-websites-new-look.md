After a short affair with <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal </a>the website is back on <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>. Drupal is a very powerful content management system but takes A LOT of work to maintain and customize, whereas WordPress just works. If you are interested in experimenting with WordPress for you site you can follow<a href="http://lifehacker.com/214455/hack-attack-set-up-and-host-a-blog-on-your-home-computer" target="_blank"> an excellent introduction to setting up a blog on your home computer here</a> and a <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5365600/the-beginners-guide-to-tricking-out-your-wordpress-blog" target="_blank">guide to using WordPress for your website here</a>.

For now, my site is sporting this lovely brown colour because my theme of choice doesn&#8217;t want to run on the production site right now. I&#8217;ll look into this soon and the layout will switch to a much more pleasant blue theme.
