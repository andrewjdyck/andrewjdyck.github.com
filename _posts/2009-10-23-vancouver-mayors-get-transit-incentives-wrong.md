Transit is a very important subject in any urban area but it becomes even more important in larger or high density areas like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_mainland" target="_blank">Lower Mainland</a>. Today <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/10/23/bc-translink-gas-parking-tax-fares-hike.html" target="_blank">CBC reported on a decision by Vancouver mayors</a> to improve revenues for Translink, the company responsible for managing transit in the lower mainland. Unfortunately, in trying to raise money for maintaining the current system they have focused simply on raising money and ignored how their decision might alter behaviour through shifting incentives.

The plan, as proposed by Vancouver mayors is to increase the gas tax, parking fees, and transit fees to pay for transit maintenance. It is easy to understand how the first two have the potential to both raise revenue and take pressure off city infrastructure by discouraging automobile usage. However, by increasing the cost of using public transit the mayors are actually discouraging the use public transit, which may actually increase traffic congestion.

Stories such as this are a reminder that whether it&#8217;s funding Translink or another policy decision, it&#8217;s important to always consider the role of economic incentives in finding the optimal solution to that problem. Additional transit funding sources which was utilized by Vancouver mayors could be to charge tolls for entering certain areas of the city by car at certain times of day or to work with ICBC in implementing an annual tax for registering a vehicle.
