Earlier [I mentioned the website][1] [StackOverflow.com][2] which is a great way to get help with programming questions. Now on the website Area51 there is a proposal to create a similar site for questions related to statistical analysis. My hope is that the site would be a great place to find help answer questions like:

  * What is the difference between standard deviation and variance?
  * How do I use a data series in regression that doesn&#8217;t follow a normal distribution?

Click the link to [express your support for the site][3] if interested.
