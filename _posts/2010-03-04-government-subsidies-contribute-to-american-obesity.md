This infographic says it all.

What the image tells us is that government subsidies are disproportionately lowering the cost of food items thought to be responsible for obesity. When you arrive at the grocery store to find that meat is cheaper than vegetables, the decision for a thrifty shopper is to consume more of foods that may lead to obesity.

Although the post title refers to American obesity, this is only because the data used in the image is for the USA. I&#8217;d be surprised to find the situation in Canada to be any different.

I&#8217;m highlighting this story here to do a little to spread this message around. It&#8217;s clear that changing distortionary agriculture subsidies would be a good step towards improving the diets of many Canadians. As consumers we aren&#8217;t doing enough to push our governments to put an end to such subsidies.
