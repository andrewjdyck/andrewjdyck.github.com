I have often asked myself the same question so I was glad to see that someone has finally found a way to compare the two. The link below takes you to a page with a bunch of quizes about art, music, literature, etc. I scored 75% on the true art/fake quiz and 50% on the art/ape quiz. Apparently I know my bird droppings though because I scored 100% on the quiz which asks you if the picture is of a famous Pollack painting or bird droppings.

ENJOY!!

Oh, and let me know how well you did.
