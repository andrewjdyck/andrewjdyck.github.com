Lately many of my posts have involved the Stata programming language. I think that the amount I&#8217;ve been blogging about Stata warrants a blog of it&#8217;s own to separate these from other topics that I cover. So, starting today you can find my writings on Stata tips and tricks at my a new blog [Statabytes][1]. I plan to highlight short tips on using some of Stata&#8217;s most useful features as well as some interesting discussions of Stata on the web including [Statalist][2], [StackOverflow][3], and [LinkedIn][4].
