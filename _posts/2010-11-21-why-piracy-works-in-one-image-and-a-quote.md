I rented a movie from Blockbuster the other day (Clash of the Titans, which I&#8217;d give 3 stars) and I was reminded of this image below that I originally saw on [the web here][1]. Click the image to see the full version.

I also overheard the following conversation by a couple of teens in the store:

> &#8220;This movie looks cool.&#8221;  
> &#8220;Yeah, but I was looking for something else.&#8221;  
> &#8220;Let&#8217;s just go home and watch something on the net. There&#8217;s more selection and we don&#8217;t have to return it.&#8221; 

The movie industry seems to have an uphill battle if it continues with it&#8217;s current business model.
