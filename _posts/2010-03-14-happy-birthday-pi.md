[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-594" title="pi" src="http://www.andrewdyck.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/pi-300x157.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="157" />][1]Okay, so it&#8217;s not exactly the the birthday of my second favourite transcendental number*, but today is a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day" target="_blank"> celebration</a> of the number represented by pi and our attempts to approximate it.

I must admit to being fascinated by this number &#8230; how can a fundamental constant of nature be irrational?

*I have to say that I&#8217;m partial to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_e" target="_blank">number e</a>, which helped to greatly simplify equations we were forced to tackle during my university days.
