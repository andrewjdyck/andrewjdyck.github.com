Had some very welcome interest in the [openfisheries.org][1] project from a PhD student at UC Davis, [Carl Boettiger][2]. Due to this interest I&#8217;ve pushed out some [decent updates to the data API][3], so now you can download fishery landings data either globally, by country, or by species group in the familiar JSON format. Ever since seeing [this graphic][4] using the openfisheries data today, my mind in buzzing with the potential of including more and more fishery data sources in the API to see what others will create. 

For the time being, the data API is only available with the use of an API key, to prevent crashes due to unforeseen vulnerabilities in my coding. But, that&#8217;s not very open of me, is it? In the next few days I will be shoring up the API coding and lifting the API key requirement so that all can use it. When I do so, I&#8217;ll post an update here with links to the API connection info.
