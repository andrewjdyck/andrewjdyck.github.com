Related to my <a href="http://www.andrewdyck.com/2009/the-economics-of-scientific-collaboration/" target="_blank">recent post on scientific collaboration</a>, I&#8217;ve finally been invited to join <a href="http://infochimps.org/" target="_blank">InfoChimps.org</a>, a website and aggregates and searches datasets from users.

The site is very young and so far I&#8217;ve found very few datasets on concerning fisheries economics save for <a href="http://infochimps.org/datasets/fisheries-quantity-and-value-of-domestic-catch:-1960-to-2005" target="_blank">U.S.A. catch and value data for 1960-2005</a>. For this particular dataset, it is available for download for free in various formats (including CSV!). Infochimps seems to do a pretty good job of requiring people submitting datasets to cite their sources and describe the data. A snippet of the data is included without having to download so you can get an idea of what you&#8217;ll get.

From the point of view of a researcher it&#8217;s good to see movements like this that could expedite research by decreasing wait times for data. (ie. I&#8217;m waiting on a dataset from the OECD to be delivered for two weeks now and I&#8217;m told it could be up to 6 weeks).

From the point of view of an economist this is exciting news because the folks at Infochimps are attempting to consolidate a market for data and barely exists right now. There must be Terabytes of data sitting on the computers of researchers who would share (perhaps for a fee) with others but no one has asked. Likewise, there are plenty of researchers who need data (and may be willing to pay rather than collect themselves) but don&#8217;t know where or who to ask.

For me, I hope data aggregation services like this become the norm in the near future.
