It&#8217;s not too surprising that the Alakrana, a Spanish tuna fishing boat subsidized with â‚¬ 4.3 million ($5.8 million USD), has caught illegally fishing off the coast of Somalia. For me, what is more interesting is that there seems to be some meat to the theory that there is a link between Somali piracy and fishing. It is thought that international vessels took advantage of the political turmoil in Somalia by aggressively fishing in Somali waters and depleting that country&#8217;s fishery resources. Somali fishermen, who now must deal with depleted fisheries, struggle to make a decent living and turn to more desperate activities like piracy.
