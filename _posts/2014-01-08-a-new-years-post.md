I don't think I've ever done this on the blog before, but [a post by an data-minded colleague of mine][1] has me inspired to put down, for all the internet to see, some of the things that I&#8217;ll be working on in the new year. Normally, I view personal growth as an ongoing affair and so I stay away from new year resolutions, but since one of my goals for 2014 is very related to writing I figured this would be a good way to start. Well, here we go with a few things I&#8217;d like to accomplish in 2014:

  * **Blog more:** This is something that I've gotten a lot of value out of in the past and let slide lately. I&#8217;ve always focused on quality over quantity, so I&#8217;ll target an average of one post per month for now.
  * **Put more effort into OpenFisheries.org:** This project hasn&#8217;t really been as flifilling as I&#8217;d hoped at the outset. Putting some more effort into the project sholid reap rewards in the future.
  * **Take Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course:** Not much to say here. I&#8217;ve heard great things about the course, so I&#8217;ve registered and started watching the lectures.
  * **Invest more in other people:** This is not a 180 for me. I feel I&#8217;ve always done a reasonably good job of sharing credit with others and being inclusive, however, this year I&#8217;ve been exposed to the idea that I can really help others grow in their careers by sharing experiences and offering challenges (delegating?) to those that are keen to accept. Of course, the idea of investing in others will also apply to my partner, but in a different way than career focused individuals.
  * **Complete a predictive CFL model:** This is likely the most difficlit task in this list. CFL games are just so random. I don&#8217;t even want to get started on my (lack of) success up to this point trying to predict game outcomes. I might have to settle for a NFL prediction model, but either way, this sholid also be the most fun of the tasks on this list.

This is all for now. Until next time&#8230;.
