Just wanted to share an [interesting comment I saw on Greg Mankiw&#8217;s blog today][1] which is attributed to [United States Congressman Barney Frank][2].

> &#8220;Not for the first time, as an elected official, I envy economists. Economists have available to them, in an analytical approach, the counterfactual. Economists can explain that a given decision was the best one that could be made, because they can show what would have happened in the counterfactual situation. They can contrast what happened to what would have happened. No one has ever gotten reelected where the bumper sticker said, &#8220;It would have been worse without me.&#8221; You probably can get tenure with that. But you can&#8217;t win office.&#8221;

I have a feeling that this rationale has brought about the beginning, and end, of many very interesting relationships. <img src="http://wp.andrewdyck.com/cms/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
