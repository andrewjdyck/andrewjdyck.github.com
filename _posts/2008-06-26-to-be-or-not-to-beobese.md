When I was on the plane to Regina I saw an interesting news clip on tv about a new report put out by <a href="http://www.fraserinstitute.org/newsandevents/commentaries/5642.aspx" target="_blank">the Fraser Institute</a>. From the article&#8217;s abstract:

> &#8220;A recent study suggests that while obesity is costly on an annual basis, it is actually less costly than a healthier lifestyle over a lifetime.&#8221;

I&#8217;ll save my personal comments except to say that the article is certainly interesting.

I&#8217;ll hopefully have some decent pics from my trip to the lake posted when I get back on monday.

R.I.P.  CFL pool.  I guess this isn&#8217;t going to happen.  I am sad.
