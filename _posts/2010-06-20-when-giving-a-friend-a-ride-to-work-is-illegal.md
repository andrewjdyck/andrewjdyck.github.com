One of the strange things about law in Canada (and other places too) is that there are certain things that are legal when done for free but illegal when money changes hands. The oft-cited example is sex but also includes organs (becoming a donor is admirable but selling your kidney would land you in jail) and children (you can put your child up for adoption but selling one would be illegal as well as morally repugnant for most).

Eric at the Freakonomics blog points out another common action that is legal when done freely but illegal if you are paid for it. He says:

> &#8220;the simple act of driving passengers around is a crime — when it is done for cash.&#8221;

The law requires taxi cab drivers to have a permit to transport people for money and these permits are, in most cases, heavily restricted. Is it to protect consumers from riding with sketchy folks or in shoddy vehicles or just a way to ensure nice profits for cab drivers?

The cab story is interesting because

  1. it&#8217;s weird when you really think about it that it can be legal to get a ride with a friend to work but if you offer some money for gas  you are a criminal and;
  2. there are real implications for cities that suffer traffic congestion and/or inadequate public transit.

Regarding point 2, opening up restrictions to cab drivers could have many positive benefits for cities with clogged roads and poor transit options. Think about the possibilities if you had the option to cram yourself onto an over-packed bus or pay a couple dollars to flag a ride from a fellow motorist &#8211; with or without the on-duty sign on the roof.
