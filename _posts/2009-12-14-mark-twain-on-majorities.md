Just read a really simple but inspiring quote by American author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_twain" target="_blank">Mark Twain</a>:

> &#8220;Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.&#8221;

This is something that we should be sure to keep in mind at all times.
