To be honest, I&#8217;m surprised that they actually <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html" target="_blank">followed through</a> on their commitment to stop censoring the web in China. However, it looks like a positive move for free speech on the net.

Google has also setup<a href="http://www.google.com/prc/report.html#hl=en" target="_blank"> this webpage</a> to track the status of Google services blocked in China. In a few days time I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see that all services are blocked but who knows what the Chinese government will end up doing.
