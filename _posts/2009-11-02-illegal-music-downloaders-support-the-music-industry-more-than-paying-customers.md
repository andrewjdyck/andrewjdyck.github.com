After [a story like this][1] you know that somewhere a [RIAA][2] official&#8217;s head exploded.

The story explains that a (small) sample of internet users suggest that the average music pirate spends more on music than the average non-pirate. And, if the results are correct pirates spend quite a lot more than those who do not illegally download music &#8211; 77 pounds for pirates vs. 44 pounds for those who stay legit.

So, how could these results be true? Well, the first thing to recognize is that the results are based on a poll of just 1,000 people and just 10% of these respondents admitted to downloading music illegally. The sample is small and it&#8217;s uncertain how forthcoming people were about the legality of their on-line activity. That said, I can think of a few other reasons to explain why illegal music downloads are beneficial to the music industry.

  1. Downloading music reduces risk for consumers
Can you believe that I paid more than $25 for the White Stripes Elephant album? At the time I was working a part-time job and $25 was a significant portion of my disposable income. Luckily, Elephant is a spectacular album and I have it to this day but I wouldn&#8217;t say the same for my purchase of Moby&#8217;s post-Play album, 18, which, in my opinion, was a dud. When one downloads music illegally, they aren&#8217;t stuck with a $25 coaster if they don&#8217;t like it.

Because I&#8217;m an economist I&#8217;ll express this with a simple equation below:

![][3]

where Pi represents the pleasure one gets from listening to an album, CD is the price of an album, and ![][4] is the probability that an album purchase lets you down. ![][5] is decreasing in ![][4] so as the probability of buying a dud album goes down ![][5] increases and the total expected benefit of an album purchase increases as well, and for music lovers, this additional expected benefit can be risklessly spent on more music.

  2. Music pirates are music lovers
Although it may not cost money to download music illegally, it does take time searching for new artists and learning about what you should listen to next. All this time researching music means that pirates are more likely to discover new artists and share their discoveries with others. Furthermore, since the web loves to put ads everywhere, people who spend time looking for music on the web will eventually click some of those sponsored ads on the sidebar and wind up buying some sort of music paraphenalia.</ol> 

Whether or not the music industry finds a way to finally bend the law in their favour, one thing is certain, the internet has changed the music industry. Consumers have gotten used to music at their fingertips when they want it and it will be difficult to change back. The age of the $25 album purchase is not coming back but what the future will be is impossible to predict. Perhaps I&#8217;ll chime in with some ideas later on.
