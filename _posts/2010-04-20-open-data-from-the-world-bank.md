According to the World Bank, they have opened up more than 2,000 indicators to be downloaded in various formats including Excel, CSV, XML, and SDMX. Among the databases currently available are:

  * World Development Indicators
  * African Development Indicators
  * Education Statistics

Additionally, the World Bank reports that a public API will be available for developers to use the data in web applications. It looks like the API might be available for some of the databases already but haven&#8217;t really looked into it.

Hopefully this is part of a trend in transparency that will continue in many other public organizations. I hope that the future brings strength to the data openness movement in Canada in particular.
