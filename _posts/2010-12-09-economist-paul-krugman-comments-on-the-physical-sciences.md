Looking through some old blog post drafts I found this and, although not timely, the content is still relevant since the discussion of cap-and-trade emissions reduction programs is ongoing in one for or another.

Discussing a recent article by climatologist James Hensen, Paul Krugman explains the differences between carbon taxes and a cap-and-trade system. After explaining that Hensen may be confused about how incentives work under the two systems Krugman says this:

> Things like this often happen when economists deal with physical scientists; the hard-science guys tend to assume that we’re witch doctors with nothing to tell them, so they can’t be bothered to listen at all to what the economists have to say, and the result is that they end up reinventing old errors in the belief that they’re deep insights. 

It is an interesting observation that, unfortunately, is all too common. Expanding on this theme, Krugman also says:

> [W]hile I defer to [James Hensen] on all matters climate, [today’s op-ed article][1] suggests that he really hasn’t made any effort to understand the economics of emissions control.

Translating for Canadians, imagine coaching a hockey dream team with power forwards Gretzky and Crosby in the line up. Although they are both amazing players, you&#8217;d be a fool to put either one in net. Rather, you&#8217;d best leave those two on offence and look for a great net-minder to keep the puck out of the net. Recognizing one&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses and specializing in your strengths not only makes sense in sport, but could be useful in research as well.
