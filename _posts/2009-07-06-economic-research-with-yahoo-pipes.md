While government may be well-meaning in supporting fishermen when times get tough, subsidizing this industry not only has important implications for free-trade but can augment the incentive to over-fish ocean resources.

The project that I&#8217;ve been working on as part of the Global Ocean Economics Project aims to increase the availability and transparency of government subsidization of the fishing industry around the globe. At times, this data is already publicly available and it is a simple matter to incorporate this into our project. In other cases, since subsidies are a hot topic in international trade negotiation, data is not reported or available publicly available.

To find subsidy information when it&#8217;s not officially reported we utilize news stories from around the globe. Sorting through the world news every day would be a really big job if it weren&#8217;t for great tools like [Yahoo! Pipes][1]. With the pipe I created with Yahoo! I get notified automatically via Google Reader, my RSS feed reader, whenever a story anywhere in world is published involving fisheries subsidies.

Pipes are a very powerful tool for customizing and creating RSS feeds. I&#8217;m certain that [the Pipe I&#8217;ve created to track fisheries subsidies news stories][2] only scrapes the surface of what Yahoo! Pipes can do. So, take a moment to check out Pipes, [watch some of their instructional videos][3] and discover what uses you can find for them.
