An interesting<a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2010/01/the-environmental-kuznets-curve-seeking-empirical-regularity-and-theoretical-structure----carson-4-1-3----review-of-envir.html" target="_blank"> post on the environmental economics website</a> today. The short post (which is just the <a href="http://reep.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/4/1/3" target="_blank">abstract from this article</a>) begs the question: Is economic growth good or bad for the environment?

While there are many who believe that growth is the cause of many environmental ailments, there is some evidence to support the idea that rising income levels may actually be good for the environment. To see how the later works <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve#Environmental_Kuznets_Curves" target="_blank">look into environmental Kuznets curves</a>.

This paper seems to suggest, however, that income is not the driver of environmental sustainability. Rather,

> More plausible explanations for the observed data revolve around good government, effective regulation, and diffusion of technological change.

At first glace this seems plausible except that good government, effective regulation, and diffusion of technological change is highly correlated with income. In fact, I&#8217;d argue, much like <a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2010/01/the-environmental-kuznets-curve-seeking-empirical-regularity-and-theoretical-structure----carson-4-1-3----review-of-envir.html?cid=6a00d83451bd4869e20120a7cec967970b#comment-6a00d83451bd4869e20120a7cec967970b" target="_blank">commenter Joshua Corning</a>, that income could be a proxy for these three items.

The commenter expresses that the issues are related by saying:

> The argument seems to be that there is some Green hypothetical mythical country with good government that has effective regulation and a diffusion of technological change yet somehow remains poor.
