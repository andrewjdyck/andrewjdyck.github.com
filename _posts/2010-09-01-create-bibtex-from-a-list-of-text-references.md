Some prefer to manually cite and reference documents that they work on. I am not one of those people. This method, especially when working collaboratively, often results in repeating the same double-check for references and style formatting over and over and&#8230;..

I much prefer to use a reference manager like [Zotero][1] which makes it unbelievably easy to get your references into. Most times, you can just drop a PDF in and then find the reference data based on info in the PDF. But, more about Zotero in a later post perhaps. For now, what do you do when you receive a huge list of references in APA/MLA/etc. format and want to add them to your reference manager? 

For this task I&#8217;ve used [a tool from Makino Takaki][2] fairly successfully a few times now to convert a list of text references to BibTeX and then import into Zotero. It&#8217;s not foolproof and you&#8217;ll have to double-check in the import but it&#8217;s a start. 

I&#8217;m hoping that someone with more time available than myself will take his source code and tweak it to improve this tool.
