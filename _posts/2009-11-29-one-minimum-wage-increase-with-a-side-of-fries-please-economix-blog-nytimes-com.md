You can file this one under strange economic relationships.

> As you may know, Americans have indeed been getting more obese over the last couple of decades, with increased consumption of fast foods contributing to that enlargement. During most of that period, the inflation-adjusted federal minimum wage had been falling.
> 
> A recent study by the researchers David Meltzer from the University of Chicago and Zhuo Chen from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now finds that low inflation-adjusted minimum wages are partly to blame for increased obesity.

For me this story inspires mixed feelings. The human being in me feels that minimum wages are something that we should use to ensure that workers have a decent standard of living. The economist in me is a skeptic and feels that there are likely other effects to minimum wage laws. Looks like the data, for the USA anyway, is suggesting that the minimum wage may at least have one unintended effect where an increase in the minimum wage could decrease obesity. Sounds great, minimum wage caused reductions in obesity could come at the cost of higher unemployment.
