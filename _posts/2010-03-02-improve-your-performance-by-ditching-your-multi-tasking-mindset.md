Although far from conclusive evidence, <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Scholars-Turn-Their-Attention/63746/" target="_blank">a recent study</a> picked up by the <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">Freakonomics blog</a> highlights that:

> “self-described multitaskers performed much worse on cognitive and memory tasks that involved distraction than did people who said they preferred to focus on single tasks.”

It may seem strange since many of us have been taught to believe that the key to productivity is to do more things at the same time. Indeed, many employers even look for this as a quality in new hires.

The fact is that multi-tasking like chewing gum while walking is much different than writing a report and analyzing data at the same time. Gina Trapani of the<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/article/work-smart-stop-multi-tasking-and-do-one-thing-at-a-time" target="_blank"> Work Smart blog</a> says it well:

> &#8220;You&#8217;re juggling. When you juggle tasks, your work suffers AND takes longer&#8211;because switching tasks costs.&#8221;

Please, do what you can to spread the word of single-tasking. Enough people talking about it just might convince employers of single-tasking productivity gains&#8230;.but, you might not want to do it in an interview situation just yet.
