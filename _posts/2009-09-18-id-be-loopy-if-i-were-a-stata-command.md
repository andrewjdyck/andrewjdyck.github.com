I just saw the most interesting Facebook quiz I&#8217;ve ever come across today. The quiz is titled &#8220;Which Stata command are you?&#8221; and after answering five questions provides an answer. Turns out I&#8217;d be the &#8216;foreach&#8217; command, which is used in programming to create loops. Here is the summary of my results:

> You are the type of person who is always trying to avoid unnecessary dirty work especially if there is a suitable shortcut. Your first question is always: How can I run this quicker? But be carefull: sometimes it is inevitable to take the long road and walk it.

Coincidentally, I actually use the foreach command quite a lot in my work. It really does help simplify analysis. In the future I should write a quick example of how this is used in Stata programming.
