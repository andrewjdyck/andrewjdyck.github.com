Phil at the blog <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/mlm/" target="_blank">Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science</a> discusses a really hot topic right now with the coolest of heads you&#8217;re likely to encounter. He says that characterizing people as climate change &#8216;believers&#8217;, &#8216;deniers&#8217;, or &#8216;skeptics&#8217; doesn&#8217;t do justice to the wide range of thought on the topic. Rather, Phil suggests that:

> &#8220;[m]aybe we should start characterizing people by a single number, as follows. What probability do you assign to the following statement: increasing the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration above 800 ppm will change the global average surface temperature by more than 2.5 degrees C 4.5 F?&#8221;

That is, think about how confident you are that &#8216;the science is in&#8217; regarding human-induced climate change. Phil thinks of himself as about 90% certain CO2 concentration of 800ppm is trouble.Â He also goes on to say that people who claim to be very confident (>99.99% probability) are probably out to lunch. The same would be true of those who claim to be less than 10% confident that CO2 is the culprit behind global warming.

For me, I don&#8217;t know where my confidence is that &#8216;the science is settled&#8217; on global warming. I&#8217;d be lying to say that what&#8217;s been dubbed &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_e-mail_hacking_incident" target="_blank">climategate</a>&#8216; hasn&#8217;t affected my confidence in climate science and science in general for that matter. There are leaps and bounds to be made in terms of transparency in this world &#8212; even in the scientific community.
