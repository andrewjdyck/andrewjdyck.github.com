Okay, a follow-up to [my earlier discussion of restrictions to cab drivers][1]. An interesting idea to consider is the unintended effect of keeping cab prices artificially high through limiting taxi licenses. As price of cab increases the number of people driving drunk (because it costs too much) will increase and so will the number of drunk-driving related fatalities. Lame excuse or not, high prices for taxis / public transport will affect the decision to drive drunk for some people out there.

> How much does it cost to take a cab? According to this web site, a three-mile cab ride will cost you about $8 plus tip in most major cities. After a tip, that is about $3 per mile â€” not too different than the implied cost per mile of driving drunk.
