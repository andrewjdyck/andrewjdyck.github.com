Kwanghui Lim of Core Economics notes in a recent blog post that:

> &#8220;Ironically, it is now easier to download and install linux than it is to install Windows 7.&#8221;

The quote comes from the author&#8217;s experience installing the new Windows 7 operating system. I had the pleasure of trying out the beta release of Windows 7 a few months back and it was relatively easy doing a clean install. But the difficulty Kwanghui has is completely understandable and, I believe, stems from Microsoft&#8217;s poor implementation of a price-discrimination strategy in marketing their product. The term price-discrimination sounds bad but it&#8217;s just economic-speak for selling the same good to different people at different prices. See wikipedia for a little more information about how price-discrimination works.

Microsoft&#8217;s strategy to maximize profit is to sell different versions of their operating system, which do pretty much the same thing, at different prices to different people. ie. people who consider themselves a basic user will likely go for Windows Home Basic and pay the base price, while more experienced users who want all the bells and whistles will buy Ultimate and pay the ultimate price. With previous versions of windows (Windows XP) this was an excellent strategy but it&#8217;s starting to fall apart and to explain why I&#8217;ll get back to the post from Core Economics.

Linux is, in general, considered to be a tool for geeks. Geeks who know how what a command line is and how to use it. But this generality is not so true as it once was. Indeed, I have found it to be quite easy to install Ubuntu Linux on many computers. And, when I compare the simplicity of downloading a free CD of Ubuntu and following the graphical install process to choosing my preferred flavour of Windows, then choosing whether it is best to upgrade or do a clean install and what that means for my computer. I haven&#8217;t even discussed the difficulty some have experienced with authenticating legit versions of Windows.

Yes, I must admit that there is still a, steep at times, learning curve with Linux and that there are also many distributions of the operating system to choose from. However, I argue that the popularity of Ubuntu means that there really is only one choice for the vast majority of folks trying out Linux. Not to mention that the increasing popularity and use of unix-based Macintosh OSX means that many people are gaining experience using a Linux-like computer.

With every new version of Ubuntu that is released, Linux is becoming more and more user-friendly while the profit strategy of Windows seems to be forcing users to jump through hoops to use software they pay dearly for. Indeed, everything is pointing to the fact that the barriers to people adopting a Linux operating system are slowly eroding.

I&#8217;m not ready to dance on the grave of Windows just yet. I, for one, think the profit motive in a company like Microsoft, often translates to a higher quality product than open source can produce. However, Microsoft really needs to get it&#8217;s marketing strategy in order if it&#8217;s going to compete with Linux or even Chrome OS in the future.
