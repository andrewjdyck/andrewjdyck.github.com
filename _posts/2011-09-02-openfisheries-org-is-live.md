A few days ago I completed enough edits to a project I&#8217;ve been working on in my spare time to go live with [OpenFisheries.org][1]. The site is in early beta, and for now shows a [Protovis][2] implementation of what graphics on the site will look like as the dynamic elements are added.

The state of knowledge about global fisheries is really quite poor and worse yet, getting accurate data on anything is an enormous challenge. My hope for the site is to serve as a portal for those interested in fisheries, both large- and small-scale to view a summary of publicly available scientific and economic fisheries data. Additionally, since the graphic summaries are querying a MySQL database of statistics, I will offer an open API for querying and downloading the data as well as embedding graphics in other web pages.

There is a little info [about the project on the about page][3] and I hope to have [small updates on the blog][4]. For the first time, I chose to host this with [Tumblr][5] instead of [WordPress][6], so I&#8217;ll see how that goes. There is also a [Twitter handle for OpenFisheries.org][7] where I share posts related to open fisheries data.
