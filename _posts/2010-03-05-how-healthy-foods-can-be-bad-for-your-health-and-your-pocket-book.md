A reminder to check the label on foods before you buy them, **especially** if they are labeled with some combination of &#8220;healthy&#8221;, &#8220;low sugar&#8221;, &#8220;low sodium&#8221;, &#8220;heart conscious&#8221;, etc. In these products companies will sometimes boost salt content to make a food with reduced fat taste better or vice-versa.



Of course, this is no indictment of healthy eating. It&#8217;s important to make smart decisions about our diets by choosing fresh foods free of ingredients you cannot pronounce.
