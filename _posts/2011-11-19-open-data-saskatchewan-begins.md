The move towards more [open data][1], both in government and business, seems to be gaining steam around the world. As a long-time user of the [World Development Indicators (WDI)][2], I was impressed when the World Bank (WB) decided to [open up their data repository][3] to the world and started the [Apps for Development challenge][4] to spur innovation using these datasets. 

Although the honour of first prize in the Apps for Development challenge went to StatPlanet, which visualizes WDI data on a global map, I found the second and third prize winners interesting as well. In second prize, the [development timelines app][5] allows one to compare historical development statistics through time across countries. Third prize in the challenge was claimed by the [Yourtopia app][6], which allows one to mashup WDI data to show which countries around the world are most like your vision of a utopia. 

After this contest, I was absolutely floored when it was announced that Kenya would be taking the plunge into open data with a national data portal. I cannot wait to see the applications of this data in the near future.

I&#8217;ve also had the pleasure of being involved in the [open data movement in British Columbia][7] (BC) after their highly successful [data portal][8] was launched. At a hack-a-thon, where developers, enthusiasts and other citizens gather to work with open data, I was involved in creating the bones of an [occupation explorer application][9] that seeks to put data into the hands of high school students as they make education decisions about their future careers. Other great examples of applications created in hackathons at these events in BC include: 

  * [Proactive Disclosure][10]
  * [My Catch BC][11]
  * [Municipal Debt Comparitron][12]

With all these examples of open data applications and the rapid economic growth in my home province of Saskatchewan in mind, I hoped to see similar and even greater success here. With a great help and advice from other open data enthusiasts around the country I started an [organization called OpenDataSK][13] to promote open data use in Saskatchewan. So far the response has been much greater than I dreamed. I may have been in a little hasty in organizing our first hackathon in the province in order to meet [International Open Data day][14] on December 3, 2011, however, even this looks to be promising. 

I&#8217;ve collected links to several data sources in the province that could be used at the hackathon and now I cannot wait to see what happens with data enthusiasts congregate and creativity starts flowing. If you are in the province, or within reasonable travel time, I encourage you to consider attending. The location is yet to be determined, however, information when it becomes available will be both on the [OpenDataSK website][13] and the [Eventbrite event page][15].
