Maya Sen from the<a href="http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/" target="_blank"> Social Science Statistics blog</a> points out that some municipal governments in the USA are increasing transparency by releasing municipal data on topics such as crime, restaurant inspections, among others.

Obviously, the movement of data out from behind the walls of our elected officials is something that I see to be very positive. Maya Sen explains why freely accessible government data is a good thing by saying:

> For social scientists, having access to more data is never a bad thing. But, more importantly, perhaps having access to this otherwise mundane data will lessen our dependence on (notoriously unreliable) public opinion surveys. Instead of asking people how much they feel crime is affecting their particular neighborhood, we could measure it using the data provided by DataSF, data.gov.uk, and others. Instead of asking people how reliable or safe are their local hospitals, we&apos;ll be able to measure it using the same resources.

To be honest, I don&#8217;t know if the federal government, municipal or provincial governments are moving in the same direction as San Fransico or New York City in regards to data accessibility. In Vancouver, we do have access to a limited set of crime data through the <a href="http://vancouver.ca/police/Planning/Reports.htm" target="_blank">Vancouver Police Department&#8217;s Planning, Research and Audit Section</a>. Good works guys! Now if only the data were in a format that people could use rather than the default PDF.
