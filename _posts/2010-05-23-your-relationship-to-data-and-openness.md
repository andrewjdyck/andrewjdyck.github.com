As an economist my view of data I use is generally some variation of &#8220;it&#8217;s *just data*&#8221; That is, data is just one input among many that I&#8217;ll use to create something. I didn&#8217;t think too much about data other than to be frustrated when acquiring the data necessary for a given project is more than a trivial matter.

I&#8217;ve worked with many people in several different fields and I was, to be honest, more than a little surprised to find that many people, even academics, will go to great lengths to guard their data from use by others. At first I was merely frustrated by those who keep their data behind walls; if there is one thing that hinders progress and innovation it is when information is kept behind a wall.

But, I&#8217;ve come to (I hope) a better understanding of why such walls are constructed at all. Economists are intensive users of data but rarely create it so we have a difficult understanding those who do collect/create data. Those who create data, by going out and measuring the weight of various wildlife, or interviewing people about their consumption habits likely do not see themselves as *just data* sources. Rather, they feel that they are creators of something of value and they feel a deep connection to their work. When someone comes along and asks them for data it is not *just data* to them, it is their creation.

As economists, and other social scientist, we have a duty to understand the connection that some have with their data and respect that. Of course, this is not to say that I&#8217;ve changed my tune and data should be kept behind walls or encrypted on disks in building basements. [Data wants to be free][1] and it is most useful when it is freely and easily accessed. I hope that when users of data, such as myself and other social scientists, understand that the creators of data can have a deep connection to their works, we will be able to increase data openness and availability.
