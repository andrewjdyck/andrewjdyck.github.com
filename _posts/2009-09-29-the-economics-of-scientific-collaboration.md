Did you think that academics have nothing to gain from trade? On his blog, Michael Neilson has posted a (somewhat lengthy)<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/the-future-of-science-2/" target="_blank"> discussion about the future of science</a>. In it there is a very interesting section about the economics of scientific collaboration where he describes the following story of fictional Alice and Bob:

> Alice walks into a shoestore, with some money. Alice wants shoes more than she wants to keep her money, but Bob the shoestore owner wants the money more than he wants the shoes. As a result, Bob hands over the shoes, Alice hands over the money, and everyone walks away happier after just ten minutes. This rapid transaction takes place because there is a trust infrastructure of laws and enforcement in place that ensures that if either party cheats, they are likely to be caught and punished.
> 
> If shoestores operated like scientists trading ideas, first Alice and Bob would need to get to know one another, maybe go for a few beers in a nearby bar. Only then would Alice finally say “you know, I’m looking for some shoes”. After a pause, and a few more beers, Bob would say “You know what, I just happen to have some shoes I’m looking to sell”. Every working scientist recognizes this dance; I know scientists who worry less about selling their house than they do about exchanging scientific information.

Ah yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo" target="_blank">Ricardo&#8217;s</a> influence continues to be important. Perhaps even in ways he didn&#8217;t have in mind when developing his theory of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage" target="_blank">comparative advantage</a>.
