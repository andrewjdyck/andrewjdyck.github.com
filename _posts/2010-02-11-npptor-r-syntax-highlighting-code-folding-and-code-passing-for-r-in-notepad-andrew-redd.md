When I&#8217;m not using Stata for modelling I sometimes dabble with <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R.</a> In general I find that this is a good environment for modeling when you may want to keep several datasets (or data.frames as they are called in R) in memory. For better or worse, Stata allows you to keep only one dataset in memory at a time. Normally I don&#8217;t find this to be restrictive but there are times when it&#8217;s nice to be able to save some result to a matrix while keeping your working dataset in memory.

Anyway, the purpose of this post isn&#8217;t to discuss R vs. Stata &#8212; I&#8217;ll leave that for another day. For now, I just want to mention a nice tool by <a href="http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~aredd/site/?q=node/11" target="_blank">Andrew Redd</a> who has written a program using<a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" target="_blank"> AutoHotkey</a> to link the powerful text editing program <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> to R. <a href="http://www.sciviews.org/Tinn-R/" target="_blank">Tinn-R</a> is another popular text-editor for R programming but I&#8217;ve found it simpler to stick to one text-editor for all my programming needs. Check out the link below to download Andrew&#8217;s tool for use on the Windows platform. <a href="http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~aredd/files/RwithNP++.txt" target="_blank">Instructions to set it up are here</a> if necessary.
