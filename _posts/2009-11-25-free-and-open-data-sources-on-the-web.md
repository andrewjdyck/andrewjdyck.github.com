The web is open and free&#8230;..at least for now. However, finding open sources of good quality data can be tricky at times. Michael over at the [Dataspora Blog][1] has compiled this short list of a few sources of data on the web.

  * [ Freebase][2]
  * [ Open Data Sites][3]
  * [ Swivel][4]
  * [ Datamob][5]
  * [ Numbrary][6]
  * [ Peter Skomoroch&#8217;s Delicious Data][7]
  * [ InfoChimps][8]

Not all of them are free, &#8216;as in beer&#8217;, but I&#8217;m a big fan of InfoChimps <a href="http://www.andrewdyck.com/infochimps-centralizes-data-and-improves-market-for-datasets/" target="_self">as I&#8217;ve discussed before</a>. I still have yet to submit any data to InfoChimps but I did notice the other day that they have added the ability to upload your dataset without having to e-mail it in, which, should increase the number of submissions they receive.

I&#8217;m also a fan of the idea of Freebase but haven&#8217;t really used it much yet. To be honest, it always looked cluttered to me whenever I had a few minutes to play around with it.

Have you used any of these data sources? Any other gems to add to the list?
