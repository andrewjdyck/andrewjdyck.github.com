Scientists say that the recent earthquake off the coast of Chile may have permanently shifted the axis of the earth&#8217;s rotation, effectively shortening the length of each day by 1.26*10<sup>-6</sup> seconds. That&#8217;s about one millionth of a second every day.

So what does an earthquake in Chile mean for income and welfare in Canada? Let&#8217;s do some quick and dirty math for fun:

1.26*10<sup>-6</sup> seconds lost each day \* 365 days \* 35 million Canadians = 16,096.5 seconds lost each year.

16,096.5 seconds lost each year / 3600 seconds per hour = 4.47 hours lost each year

$38,000 gdp per capita / [1717 hours average work year][1] = $22 per hour average Canadian hourly wage.

$22 * 4.5 hours = $99 lost every year

Finally, we can approximate the net present value (NPV) of this yearly loss into the future using an assumed average Canadian discount rate of 3%.

NPV = $100 / 0.03 = $3,333.33

So, an earthquake in Chile costs Canada $3,333. Of course, this is just a tiny drop in the bucket when compared to total Canadian GDP but it was still fun to calculate wasn&#8217;t it?[][2]
