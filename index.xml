      <description>As of the end of 2014 (the last time I published), I have published nine peer-reviewed and other publications that have been cited one or more times according to Google Scholar. Through publications spanning Economics and Environmental Sciences, these publications have been cited throughout the fisheries and economics domains. As of February 2018, my works were cited nearly 600 times for an h-index measure of 9.
More about my publication history can be found via Google Scholar, IDEAS or Mendeley.</description>

      <description>Since 2011, I&amp;rsquo;ve been organizing hackathons and collecting open data sources for the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. I cannot take credit for for it, but since the project began there have been 2 open data portals spring up in Saskatchewan (Regina &amp;amp; Saskatoon).
I continue to pull together whatever scattered open data sources may exist into the project website, http://www.opendatask.ca/.</description>

      <description>I am an individual motivated by data-driven decision making, especially when applied to environmental issues. I have worked as a Fisheries Economist, Credit Risk Analyst, and founded two non-profit organizations, OpenFisheries.org and Open Data Saskatchewan. These two organizations are focused on improving the data availability, accessibility, and promotion of the message of transparency.
My wife Jen and I have a daughter and two cats. We enjoy travel and spending time outdoors as much as possible.</description>

      <title>Compute the product of a column of data using SQL</title>

      <description>In SQL, summing a column of numbers is relatively trivial, and the size of the dataset isn&amp;#8217;t important. For example:
SELECT SUM(X) as SUMOFX FROM data_table;  Mathematically, what we are doing here is:
$$SUMOFX = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$
Now, if we find ourselves in the unfortunate situation to compute this:
$$PRODUCTOFX = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i$$
In this case, it won&amp;#8217;t be as easy to use the SQL code above, but we can use Euler&amp;#8217;s number and a property of the natural logarithm to also make this task a trivial one.</description>
