<!--  <h1>Ideas on how to &#8220;fix&#8221; fisheries subsidies</h1>-->

  <div class="entry">
    <p>A friend of mine recently asked me how an economist might solve the issue of subsidies to the world’s fisheries, which some including myself, think are promoting overexploitation of fish around the world. I kept my response as short as possible (sometimes I get wordy in e-mail) but wanted to expand on some ideas here.</p>

<p>My suggestions on how to ‘fix’ fisheries subsidies with additional comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it would be safe to blanket ban fuel subsidies which is a decent chunk of the world total. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>On second thought, even fuel subsidies are a tough subject. Not all the world’s fisheries are collapsing so where a fishery is under-exploited it could make sense to subsidize a local ‘infant’ fishing industry’s fuel consumption so they can compete with the larger international fleets. The issue gets tougher yet when it comes to thinking about domestic vs. imported food sources, which I’m sure is important in some areas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Outside of fuel subsidies it is a very difficult subject. Is there a commonly used standard of sustainability in a fishery that cannot be bent to the will of those seeking financial assitance from the public purse? To what degree is a country’s development status (“developing” or “developed”) correlated with the development of fisheries targeted by that nation’s inhabitants? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My thought was that, if only we could allow just the ‘good’ subsidies for things that promote sustainability. But, it seems that the term ‘sustainability’ has lost much of it’s meaning and there seems to be a general lack of methods for measuring sustainable fisheries.</p>

<p>I’m also curious about what the effect of having different rules for “developing” and “developed” countries. As Hans Rosling has shown, it is becoming increasingly difficult to categorize a country into one or the other category. Furthermore, even if one could place a country safely into one category of development, the fishing industry is generally a very small percentage of that nation’s economy (between 0 – 2%). It’s not clear to me (but I’m open to seeing further data) that a country’s status as “developed” or “developing”, if one could categorize a country as such, will have anything to do with the development of a country’s fisheries. It is common for fishing communities to be quite removed from metropolitan areas so a highly developed country could include fishing communities with very poor inhabitants. The converse could also be true, where a country with low development includes some communities that have benefited greatly from injections of development aid, or are simply doing well for themselves in comparison to others in their country or other fishermen and women around the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A suggestion for a passive but effective step towards reducing harmful subsidies in the fishing industry would be to outright ban all payments from government to the fishing industry that are not well-documented, quantified and submitted to a neutral body such as the WTO. Sure, subsidies that are submitted would still be allowed, but this could have a cooling effect on subsidization by forcing everyone’s laundry to be laid out on the line. Dirty items will be easier to spot and, hopefully, government will be less likely to engage in harmful subsidy programs if they know that their competitors (other governments) can see their playbook and call an audible (i.e. report them to WTO). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought this was a great idea at the time of writing. Transparency in government seems to be exploding these days with initiatives like the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org">World Bank’s open data</a>, <a href="http://www.gapminder.org">Hans Rosling’s Gapminder</a>, the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/data">Guardian datastore</a>, <a href="http://www.fishsubsidy.org">fishsubsidy.org</a>, and the <a href="http://feru.org">Fisheries Economics Research Unit</a> (where I work), among others. However, I remain cautiously optimistic about how increased transparency in fisheries subsidies can promote fisheries that are well-managed and free of government-fuelled (literally) over-exploitation.</p>
