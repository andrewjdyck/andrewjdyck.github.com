<p>I am a data science leader motivated by data-driven decision making, especially when applied to environmental issues. I have experience in the field of fisheries economics, credit risk modelling, and leading data science teams.</p>

<p>I'm inspired by opportunity for open data and data science to change make meaningful change in our world. I write about economic and social trends in my home province of Saskatchewan on <a href="https://opendatask.substack.com/?r=697fo&utm_campaign=pub&utm_medium=web">Substack</a> and I contribute to a handful of open source data science projects on <a href="https://github.com/andrewjdyck">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>My wife, daughter, and I enjoy spending time outdoors as much as possible.</p>
